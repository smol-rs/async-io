//! Async I/O and timers.
//!
//! This crate provides two tools:
//!
//! * [`Async`], an adapter for standard networking types (and [many other] types) to use in
//!   async programs.
//! * [`Timer`], a future or stream that emits timed events.
//!
//! For concrete async networking types built on top of this crate, see [`async-net`].
//!
//! [many other]: https://github.com/smol-rs/async-io/tree/master/examples
//! [`async-net`]: https://docs.rs/async-net
//!
//! # Implementation
//!
//! The first time [`Async`] or [`Timer`] is used, a thread named "async-io" will be spawned.
//! The purpose of this thread is to wait for I/O events reported by the operating system, and then
//! wake appropriate futures blocked on I/O or timers when they can be resumed.
//!
//! To wait for the next I/O event, the "async-io" thread uses [epoll] on Linux/Android/illumos,
//! [kqueue] on macOS/iOS/BSD, [event ports] on illumos/Solaris, and [wepoll] on Windows. That
//! functionality is provided by the [`polling`] crate.
//!
//! However, note that you can also process I/O events and wake futures on any thread using the
//! [`block_on()`] function. The "async-io" thread is therefore just a fallback mechanism
//! processing I/O events in case no other threads are.
//!

//! # Examples
//!
//! Connect to `example.com:80`, or time out after 10 seconds.
